# Insertion Sort in C++

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the **Insertion Sort** algorithm, a simple and intuitive sorting method:

1. Iterates through an array, inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.
2. Sorts numbers in **ascending order**.

It displays the array before and after sorting to help visualize how insertion sort organizes the elements.
